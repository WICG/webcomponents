        This spec is being updated for <em>Shadow DOM v1</em>. In the meantime, the spec might be fragile, including a lot of unresolved references and inconsistency.
        See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/289">#289</a> to track the progress.
      </p>

        This specification describes a method of combining multiple DOM trees into one hierarchy and how these trees interact with each other within a document, thus
        enabling better composition of the DOM.

      <h2>Conformance</h2>

      <p>All diagrams, examples, notes, are non-normative, as well as sections explicitly marked as non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

      <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]]. For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

      <p>To help with layering and to avoid circular dependencies between various parts of specification, this document consists of three consecutive narratives:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>setting up the stage for the specification,</li>
        <li>explaining of the conceptual model and algorithms behind it, and</li>
        <li>expressing this model with DOM interfaces and HTML elements.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In a sense, these parts can be viewed as <em>math</em>, which sets up the reasoning environment, <em>physics</em>, which is the theoretical reasoning about the concept, and <em>mechanics</em>, which is the practical application of this reasoning.</p>

      <p>Any point, at which a conforming UA must make decisions about the state or reaction to the state of the conceptual model, is captured as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>. The algorithms are defined in terms of processing equivalence. The <dfn>processing equivalence</dfn> is a constraint imposed on the algorithm implementors, requiring the output of the both UA-implemented and the specified algorithm to be exactly the same for all inputs.</p>

        <h3>Shadow trees</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>document tree</dfn> is a <a>node tree</a> [[!DOM]] whose <a>root</a> <a>node</a> is a <a>document</a>.</p>

        <p>Any element can <dfn lt="hosts">host</dfn> zero or one associated <a lt="node tree">node trees</a>, called a <dfn>shadow tree</dfn>.

        <p>A <dfn>shadow host</dfn> is an element that <a>hosts</a> one <a lt="node tree">shadow tree</a>.

        <p>A shadow tree has an associated flag, called an <dfn>encapsulation mode</dfn>, which is either <dfn>open</dfn> or <dfn>closed</dfn>.

        <p>A <dfn>shadow root</dfn> is the <a>root</a> <a>node</a> of a shadow tree.</p>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>deep child</dfn> of a node <var>B</var>,
          if either <var>A</var> is a child of <var>B</var> or A is the <a>root</a> node of the <a>shadow tree</a> that B <a>hosts</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>deep descendant</dfn> of a node <var>B</var>,
          if either <var>A</var> is a <a>deep child</a> of <var>B</var>
          or <var>A</var> is a <a>deep child</a> of a node <var>C</var> that is a <a>deep descendant</a> of <var>B</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
          An <dfn>inclusive deep descendant</dfn> is a node or one of its <a lt="deep descendant">deep descendants</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>deep parent</dfn> of a node <var>B</var>
          if and only if <var>B</var> is a <a>deep child</a> of <var>A</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>deep ancestor</dfn> of a node <var>B</var>
          if and only if <var>B</var> is a <a>deep descendant</a> of <var>A</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
          An <dfn>inclusive deep ancestor</dfn> is a node or one of its <a lt="deep ancestor">deep ancestors</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When an element is an <a>inclusive deep descendant</a> of a <a>document element</a>, it is <dfn>in a document deeply</dfn>.

        <h3>Trees of trees</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>tree of trees</dfn> is a <a>tree</a> of <a lt="node tree">node trees</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">
          The purpose of introducing a tree of trees here is to define algorithms easily in the following sections.
          This is a kind of a notation techchique to make the this specification simpler.
        </p>

        <p>Just like a <a>node tree</a> is defined as <a lt="tree">a set of relationships</a> between <a lt="node">nodes</a>,
          a <a>tree of trees</a> is similarly defined as a set of relationships between <a lt="node tree">node trees</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <a>node tree</a> <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>parent tree</dfn> of a <a>node tree</a> <var>B</var> if B is a shadow tree and the shadow host which hosts <var>B</var> participates in <var>A</var>.
          </li>
          <li>If there is more than one <a>node tree</a> that shares the same <a>parent tree</a>, the <a>tree order</a> between them in the <a>tree of trees</a> is defined as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>Let <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> be <a lt="node tree">node trees</a> that share the same <a>parent tree</a>.</li>
              <li><var>A</var> comes before <var>B</var> if the <a>shadow host</a> which <a>hosts</a> <var>A</var> is <a>preceding</a> the <a>shadow host</a> which <a>hosts</a> <var>B</var>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Other relationships and terms, such as <dfn>root tree</dfn>, <dfn>child tree</dfn>,
            <dfn>descendant tree</dfn>, <dfn>inclusive descendant tree</dfn>,
            <dfn>ancestor tree</dfn>, <dfn>inclusive ancestor tree</dfn>,
            <dfn>preceding tree</dfn>
            are defined in the similar way as defined in <a lt="tree">trees</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A <a>node tree</a> <var>A</var> is called an <dfn>unclosed tree</dfn> of a <a>node tree</a> <var>B</var> if and only if one, at least, of the following conditions is satisfied:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><var>A</var> is an <a>inclusive ancestor tree</a> of <var>B</var>.</li>
          <li>The <a>encapsulation mode</a> of <var>A</var> is <a>open</a> and <var>A</var> is a <a>child tree</a> of <var>B</var>.</li>
          <li><var>A</var> is an <a>unclosed tree</a> of a <a>node tree</a> <var>C</var> that is an <a>unclosed tree</a> of <var>B</var>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called an <dfn>unclosed node</dfn> of a node <var>B</var> if and only if the <a>node tree</a> that <var>A</var> <a>participates</a> in
          is an <a>unclosed tree</a> of the <a>node tree</a> that <var>B</var> <a>participates</a> in.
        </p>

        <p>The <a><code>ownerDocument</code></a> property of a <a>node</a> in a shadow tree <strong>must</strong> refers to the <a>document</a> of the <a>shadow host</a> which <a>hosts</a> the shadow tree.</p>

        <p><a><code>Window</code></a> object <a lt="named access on the window object">named properties</a> [[!HTML]] <strong>must</strong> access the <a lt="node">nodes</a> in the <a>document tree</a>.</p>

          <h3>Example tree of trees</h3>

          <figure>
            <object data="../../assets/images/tree-of-trees.svg" width="650" height="823"></object>
            <figcaption>
              A tree of trees.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In the figure, there are six node trees, named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>F</code>.
            The shadow trees, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>, are hosted by elements which participate in the document tree <code>A</code>.
            The shadow trees, <code>E</code> and <code>F</code>, are hosted by elements which participates in the shadow tree <code>D</code>.
            The following set of relationships holds in the figure:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ordered list of <code>A</code>'s <a lt="child tree">child trees</a> is [<code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>].</li>
            <li>The ordered list of <code>B</code>'s <a lt="child tree">child trees</a> is [].</li>
            <li>The ordered list of <code>C</code>'s <a lt="child tree">child trees</a> is [].</li>
            <li>The ordered list of <code>D</code>'s <a lt="child tree">child trees</a> is [<code>E</code>, <code>F</code>].</li>
            <li>The ordered list of <code>E</code>'s <a lt="child tree">child trees</a> is [].</li>
            <li>The ordered list of <code>F</code>'s <a lt="child tree">child trees</a> is [].</li>
            <li>The document tree, <code>A</code>, is the <a>root tree</a> of the <a>tree of trees</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="note">
            <p>
              As for a relationship between nodes, it's worth mentioning that there is no <a>ancestor</a>/<a>descendant</a> relationships between two nodes if they participate in different node trees.
              A shadow root is not a <a>child</a> node of the shadow host. The <a>parent</a> node of a <a>shadow root</a> doesn't exist.
              Because of this nature, most of existing APIs are <strong>scoped</strong> and don't affect other node trees, even though they are forming one tree of trees.
              For example, <a lt="getElementById"><code>document.getElementById(elementId)</code></a> never returns an element in a shadow tree,
              even when the element has the given <code>elementId</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same thing also applies to CSS <a lt="selectors">Selectors</a> matching.
              For example, a <a lt="descendant combinators">descendant combinator</a> never descends into a node in a <a lt="child tree">child</a> <a>shadow tree</a>
              because a <a>shadow root</a> is not a <a>child</a> node of the <a>shadow host</a>.
              Unless a special CSS Selector for Shadow DOM, which is mentioned later, is used, a CSS Selector never matches an element in a different node tree.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="note">
            Because <code>ShadowRoot</code> inherits <code>DocumentFragment</code>, as <a href="#idl-def-ShadowRoot">specified</a> later,
            you can use <code>ShadowRoot.getElementByID(elementId)</code> to get a node in the <a>shadow tree</a>.

      <section>
        <h3>Composed trees</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>composed tree</dfn> is a <a>node tree</a> which is constructed out of <a lt="node">nodes</a> from multiple <a lt="node tree">node trees</a> in a <a>tree of trees</a>.
          The exact algorithm of constructing a composed tree is specified later.</p>

          <figcaption>A composed tree</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>A <dfn>document composed tree</dfn> is a <a>composed tree</a> whose root node is a document</p>

        <p>A node is <dfn>in a document composed tree</dfn> if it participates in a <a>document composed tree</a>.</p>

        <p>
          Unless an element is <a>in a document composed tree</a>, the element <strong>must</strong> not appear in the <a>formatting structure</a> [[!CSS21]] nor create any CSS <a>box</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In resolving CSS <a>inheritance</a>, an element <strong>must</strong> inherit from the parent node in the <a>composed tree</a>, if applicable.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The editor's draft of CSS Scoping specification [[css-scoping-1]] defines the selectors which are related to Shadow DOM.
            Specifically, it defines the following selectors related to Shadow DOM:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>::shadow</code> pseudo element</li>
            <li><code>/deep/</code> combinator,  which was replaced with a <code>>>></code> combinator (or <strong>shadow piercing descendant combinator</strong>)</li>
            <li><code>::content</code> pseudo-element</li>
            <li><code>:host</code> pseudo-class and <code>:host()</code> functional pseudo-class</li>
            <li><code>:host-context()</code> functional pseudo-class</li>

      <section>
        <h3>Slots</h3>

        <p>
          A <dfn>slot</dfn> is a defined location where nodes in a different <a>node tree</a> appear instead of the nodes's original position when constructing a <a>composed tree</a>.
        </p>

        <p>A <dfn>distribution</dfn> is the mechanism that determines which <a lt="node">nodes</a> appear at each <a>slot</a>. The exact algorithm of a <a>distribution</a> is specified later.</p>

          <figcaption>A distribution</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The <a>slot element</a> that satisfies all of the following conditions represents a <a>slot</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a>root</a> <a>node</a> of the <a>slot element</a> is a <a>shadow root</a></li>
          <li>There is no other <a>slot element</a> in the <a lt="ancestor">ancestors</a> of the <a>slot element</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A <dfn>slot name</dfn> is the name of a <a>slot</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <dfn>default slot</dfn> is a slot that doesn't have a <a>slot name</a>.
          If there are more than one slots which don't have a <a>slot name</a> in the same <a>shadow tree</a>, the most <a>preceding</a> one is the <a>default slot</a>. The others are not.

        <h3>Event Paths Example</h3>

        <p>
          Let's re-use the same tree of trees used in the composition example section. Suppose that an event is dispatched on node <code>I</code>. The event path will be:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>[I, H, O, T, S, R, N, J, C, A]</code>  (<a>Window</a> is omitted)
        </p>

        <p>
          It's worth pointing out that if we exclude all nodes which don't participate in the composed tree from the event path,
          the result would be equivalent to the inclusive ancestors of the node <code>I</code> in the composed tree.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <object data="../../assets/images/event-path-composed-tree.svg" width="580" height="560"></object>
          <figcaption>
            The relationship between the <a>composed tree</a> and an event path.
            If we exclude O, T, R and J, that don't participate in the composed tree, from the event path,
            the result would be equivalent to the inclusive ancestors of the node, <code>I</code>, in the <a>composed tree</a>.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Note that the <a>event path calculation algorithm</a> is designed to achieve the following goals:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            If there is a node, <var>CHILD</var>, in the event path and <var>CHILD</var> has a parent node, <var>PARENT</var>, in the node tree, the event path always includes <var>PARENT</var>.
            <var>PARENT</var> always appears somewhere after <var>CHILD</var> in the event path.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nodes in the event path form a <em>linear ancestor chain</em> in each <a>node tree</a>. There are no <em>branch points</em> in each <a>node tree</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
          <object data="../../assets/images/event-path-trees.svg" width="766" height="386">></object>
          <figcaption>
            The relationship between an event path and node trees. In the figure, a number shown in a right-side of each node represents a zero-based position of each node in the event path.
            A parent node always has a larger number than that of its child node in each node tree.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>A <em>local</em> event path for each node tree would be seen as:
        </p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Node tree</th>
              <th><em>Local</em> Event Path</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>document tree 1</td>
              <td>[I, H, C, A]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>shadow tree 1</td>
              <td>[O, N, J]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>shadow tree 2</td>
              <td>[T, S, R]</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          That means, if your concern is only one <a>node tree</a>, you can forget all other node trees.
          The event path would be seen as if the event happened only on the node tree you are focusing on.
          This is an important aspect in a sense that hosting a shadow tree doesn't have any effect to the <em>local</em> event path
          as long as the event is not stopped somewhere in the <a lt="descendant tree">descendant trees</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a web author and your concern is only a document tree, this might be a good news because an event listener that is registered somewhere on the document tree
          would <em>continue to work</em> even when you attach a shadow root to an element in the document tree to <em>enhance</em> the element.
          At the same time, an author of a shadow tree also can receive an event which will happen on a node in the document tree, if the node, or its ancestor, is assigned to a slot in the shadow tree.

        <h3>Event Retargeting</h3>

        <p>In the cases where event path is across multiple node trees, the event's information about the target of the event is adjusted in order to maintain <a href="#encapsulation">encapsulation</a>. Event <dfn>retargeting</dfn> is a process of computing relative targets for each ancestor of the <a>node</a> at which the event is dispatched. A <dfn>relative target</dfn> is a <a>node</a> that most accurately represents the target of a dispatched event at a given ancestor while maintaining the encapsulation.</p>

        <p>The <dfn>retargeting algorithm</dfn> is used to determine relative targets and <strong>must</strong> be <a lt="processing equivalence">equivalent</a> to processing the following steps:</p>

        <div class="algorithm">
          <dl>
            <dt>Input</dt>
            <dd><var>BASE</var>, a base node for which a target node should be adjusted</dd>
            <dd><var>TARGET</var>, a target node which should be adjusted</dd>
            <dt>Output</dt>
            <dd><var>RELATIVE-TARGET</var>, a <a>relative target</a>, the result of adjusting <var>TARGET</var> for <var>BASE</var></dd>
          </dl>
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>BASE-TREE</var> be the <a>node tree</a> which <var>BASE</var> <a>participates</a> in</li>
            <li>Let <var>TARGET-TREE</var> be the <a>node tree</a> which <var>TARGET</var> <a>participates</a> in</li>
            <li>If <var>BASE-TREE</var> and <var>TARGET-TREE</var> participate in the same <a>tree of trees</a>:
              <ol>
                <li>Let <var>COMMON-ANCESTOR-TREE</var> be the lowest common <a>inclusive ancestor tree</a> of <var>BASE-TREE</var> and <var>TARGET-TREE</var></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise:

                <li>Let <var>COMMON-ANCESTOR-TREE</var> be the <a>root tree</a> of <var>TARGET-TREE</var></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              For each <a>node</a>, <var>ANCETOR</var>, in an <a>inclusive deep ancestor</a> nodes of <var>TARGET</var>, from descendants to ancestors:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If <var>ANCESTOR</var> participates in <var>COMMON-ANCESTOR-TREE</var>:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Let <var>RELATIVE-TARGET</var> be <var>ANCESTOR</var></li>

        <p>The value of the <code>Event</code> object's <a><code>target</code></a> attribute <strong>must</strong> be the result of the <a>retargeting algorithm</a> with the event's <code>currentTarget</code> and <code>target</code> as input.</p>
        <p>The event target retargeting process <strong>must</strong> occur prior to dispatch of an event.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Retargeting <code>relatedTarget</code></h3>

        <p>Some events have a <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> [[!DOM-Level-3-Events]] property, which holds a <a>node</a> that's not the event's target, but is related to the event.</p>

        <p>
          For instance, a <code>mouseover</code> event's <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> may hold the <a>node</a> from which the mouse has moved to event's <code>target</code>. In the case where <code>relatedTarget</code> is in a <a>shadow tree</a>, the conforming UAs <strong>must</strong> not leak its actual value outside of this tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of the <code>Event</code> object's <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> attribute <strong>must</strong> be the result of the <a>retargeting algorithm</a> with the event's <code>currentTarget</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code> as input. The result is called a <dfn>relative related target</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event relatedTarget retargeting process <strong>must</strong> occur prior to dispatch of an event.

        <h3>Retargeting Touch Events</h3>

        <p>The <a><code>Touch</code></a> <a lt="Touch target"><code>target</code></a> [[!TOUCH-EVENTS]] attribute <strong>must</strong> be adjusted in the same way as an event with a <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a>. Each <a><code>Touch</code></a> <a lt="Touch target"><code>target</code></a> in the <a><code>TouchList</code></a> returned from <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> <a lt="touches"><code>touches()</code></a>, <a lt="changedTouches"><code>changedTouches()</code></a> and <a lt="targetTouches"><code>targetTouches()</code></a> must be the result of the <a>retargeting algorithm</a> with a current target and <a><code>Touch</code></a> <a lt="Touch target"><code>target</code></a> as input.</p>

        <h3>Retargeting Focus Events</h3>

        <p>The <code>focus</code>, <code>focusin</code>, <code>blur</code>, and <code>focusout</code> events <strong>must</strong> be treated in the same way as events with a <code>relatedTarget</code>, where the corresponding <a>node</a> that is losing focus as a result of <code>target</code> gaining focus or the <a>node</a> that is gaining focus, and thus causing the blurring of <code>target</code> acts as the related target.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Event Path Trimming</h3>

        <p>
          In cases where both <code>relatedTarget</code> and <code>target</code> of a <a lt="trusted events">trusted event</a> are part of the same <a>shadow tree</a>, the conforming UAs <strong>must</strong> <em>stop</em> events at the shadow root to avoid the appearance of spurious <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> events firing from the same node.
        </p>
        <p>
           Thus, event listeners for <a>trusted events</a> <strong>must not</strong> be invoked on a <a>node</a> for which the <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code> are the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <dfn>event path trimming algorithm</dfn> <strong>must</strong> be used to trim the event path for a <a lt="trusted events">trusted event</a> that has a <code>relatedTarget</code> attribute and
          <strong>must</strong> be <a lt="processing equivalence">equivalent</a> to processing the following steps:
        </p>
        <div class="algorithm">
          <dl>
            <dt>Input</dt>
            <dd><var>EVENT-PATH</var>, the event path, which is the result of the <a>event path calculation algorithm</a></dd>
            <dt>Output</dt>
            <dd><var>EVENT-PATH</var> is trimmed so that event listeners aren't invoked on a node for which the <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code> are the same.</dd>
          </dl>
          <ol>
            <li>
              For each object, <var>A</var>, in <var>EVENT-PATH</var>:
              <ol>
                <li>Let <var>RELATIVE-TARGET</var> be the <a>relative target</a> for <var>A</var></li>
                <li>Let <var>RELATIVE-RELATED-TARGET</var> be the <a>relative related target</a> for <var>A</var></li>
                <li>If <var>RELATIVE-TARGET</var> and <var>RELATIVE-RELATED-TARGET</var> are the same, remove <var>A</var> from <var>EVENT-PATH</var>.</li>

        <p class="note">

        <h3>Event Dispatch</h3>

        <p>At the time of event dispatch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a><code>MouseEvent</code></a> <a><code>offsetX</code></a> and <a><code>offsetY</code></a> attributes <strong>must</strong> return the coordinates relative to the origin of the <a>padding edge</a> of the <a>relative target</a></li>
          <li>When <em>capturing</em>, which entails processing step 6 of the <a lt="event dispatch">event dispatch algorithm</a>, the event listeners <strong>must not</strong> be <a lt="event listener invoke">invoked</a> on a <a>node</a> <strong>if</strong> it is the same as its <a>relative target</a></li>
          <li>When <em>bubbling</em>, which entails processing step 9 of the <a lt="event dispatch">event dispatch algorithm</a>, the <a><code>Event</code></a> <a>eventPhase</a> attribute <strong>must</strong> return <a>AT_TARGET</a> <strong>if</strong> the <a>relative target</a> is same as the <a>node</a> on which event listeners are <a lt="event listener invoke">invoked</a></li>
          <li>If the event's <a><code>bubbles</code></a> attribute value is <strong>false</strong>, run these substeps:
            <ol>
              <li>Reverse the order of <em>event path</em></li>
              <li>Initialize event's <a><code>eventPhase</code></a> attribute to <a><code>AT_TARGET</code></a></li>
              <li>For each object in <em>event path</em> where the <a>relative target</a> is same as the object, <a lt="event listener invoke">invoke</a> its <a lt="event listener">event listeners</a>, with event <em>event</em>, as long as <em>event</em>'s <a>stop propagation flag</a> is unset</li>
            </ol></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Upon completion of the event dispatch, the <a><code>Event</code></a> object's <a><code>target</code></a> and <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> <strong>must</strong> be to the highest ancestor's <a>relative target</a>. Since it is possible for a script to hold on to the <code>Event</code> object past the scope of event dispatch, this step is necessary to avoid revealing the <a lt="node">nodes</a> in <a lt="shadow tree">shadow trees</a>.</p>

        <h3>Event Retargeting Example</h3>

        <p>Suppose we have a user interface for a media controller, represented by this tree, composed of both <a>document tree</a> and the <a lt="shadow tree">shadow trees</a>. In this example, we will assume that selectors are allowed to cross the shadow boundaries and we will use these selectors to identify the <a lt="element">elements</a>. Also, we will invent a fictional <code>shadow-root</code> <a>element</a> to demarcate the shadow boundaries and represent <a lt="shadow root">shadow roots</a>:</p>
        <pre class="example">
&lt;div id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
    <span class=shadow-boundary>&lt;shadow-root id=&quot;player-shadow-root&quot;&gt;</span>
        &lt;div id=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;
            &lt;button id=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;PLAY&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;
                <span class=shadow-boundary>&lt;shadow-root id=&quot;timeline-shadow-root&quot;&gt;</span>
                    &lt;div id=&quot;slider-thumb&quot; id=&quot;timeline-slider-thumb&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                <span class=shadow-boundary>&lt;/shadow-root&gt;</span>
            &lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;div id=&quot;volume-slider-container&quot;&gt;
                &lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; id=&quot;volume-slider&quot;&gt;

                        &lt;div id=&quot;slider-thumb&quot; id=&quot;volume-slider-thumb&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    <span class=shadow-boundary>&lt;/shadow-root&gt;</span>
                &lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    <span class=shadow-boundary>&lt;/shadow-root&gt;</span>
&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>Let's have a user position their pointing device over the volume slider's thumb (<code>#volume-slider-thumb</code>), thus triggering a <code>mouseover</code> event on that node. For this event, let's pretend it has no associated <code>relatedTarget</code>.</p>

        <p>Per the <a>retargeting algorithm</a>, we should have the following set of ancestors and relative targets:</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Ancestor</th>
              <th>Relative Target</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#player</code></td>
              <td><code><strong>#player</strong></code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#player-shadow-root</code></td>
              <td><code>#volume-slider</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#controls</code></td>
              <td><code>#volume-slider</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#volume-slider-container</code></td>
              <td><code>#volume-slider</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#volume-slider</code></td>
              <td><code><strong>#volume-slider</strong></code></td>

            <tr>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>After we dispatch the <code>mouseover</code> event using these newly computed relative targets, the user decides to move their pointing device over the thumb of the timeline
          (<code>#timeline-slider-thumb</code>). This triggers both a <code>mouseout</code> event for the volume slider thumb and the <code>mouseover</code> event for the timeline thumb.</p>

        <p>Let's see how the <code>relatedTarget</code> value of the volume thumb's <code>mouseout</code> event is affected. For this event, the <code>relatedTarget</code> is the timeline thumb (<code>#timeline-slider-thumb</code>). Per the <a href="#retargeting-relatedtarget">relatedTarget retargeting</a>, we should have the following set of ancestors and adjusted related targets:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>

            <tr>
              <td><code>#player</code></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#player-shadow-root</code></td>
              <td><code>#volume-slider</code></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>#volume-slider</code></td>
              <td><code><strong>#volume-slider</strong></code></td>
              <td><code>#timeline</code></td>

            <tr>

              <td><code><strong>#timeline</strong></code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The node, <code>#player</code>, has both <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code> being the same value (<code>#player</code>), which means that we do not dispatch the event on this <a>node</a> and its ancestors.</p>

      <h2>HTML Elements in Shadow Trees</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Inertness of HTML Elements in a shadow tree</h3>

        <p>Comparatively, a <a>shadow tree</a> can be seen as somewhere between <em>just part of a <a>document</a></em> and itself being a <a lt="interface DocumentFragment">document fragment</a>. Since it is rendered, a <a>shadow tree</a> aims to retain the traits of a typical <a>tree</a> in a <a>document</a>. At the same time, it is an encapsulation abstraction, so it has to avoid affecting the <a>document tree</a>. Thus, the <a>HTML elements</a> <strong>must</strong> behave as specified [[!HTML]] in the <a lt="shadow tree">shadow trees</a>, with a few exceptions.</p>

        <p class="note">
          According to the [[!HTML]], some HTML Elements would have different behavior if they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>, instead of a document tree,
          because their definitions require the elements to be <a>in a document</a> as a necessary condition for them to work.
          In other words, they shouldn't work if they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>, even when they are <a>in a document deeply</a>.
          We must fill this gap because we expect that most of HTML Elements behave in the same way as <a>in a document</a>, as long as they are <a>in a document deeply</a>.
          See W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26365">Bug 26365</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27406">Bug 27406</a> for the details.
          The following is the tentative summary of the discussions in the W3C bugs. We, however, haven't covered all HTML Elements and their behaviors here yet.
          For HTML Elements which are not explicitly stated here, they should be considered as <a>active in a shadow tree</a>.
          We are trying to update [[!HTML]] itself, instead of having monkey patches here.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML Elements are classified into the following categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <dfn>Active in a shadow tree</dfn>
            </p>
            <p>
              A subset of <a>HTML elements</a> which <strong>must</strong> behave as if they were in the <a>document tree</a>, even when they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>,
              as long as they are <a>in a document deeply</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following HTML elements <strong>must</strong> be classified to this category:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>dialog</code></li>
              <li><code>iframe</code></li>
              <li><code>style</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <dfn>Inert in a shadow tree</dfn>:
            </p>
            <p>
              A subset of <a>HTML elements</a> which <strong>must</strong> behave as <a>inert</a>, or not part of the <a>document tree</a>, if they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>.
              This is consistent how the <a>HTML elements</a> would behave in a <a lt="interface DocumentFragment">document fragment</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following HTML elements <strong>must</strong> be classified to this category:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a lt="base element"><code>base</code></a></li>
              <li><a lt="link element"><code>link</code></a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <dfn>Inert unless being rendered</dfn>:
            </p>
            <p>
              A subset of <a>HTML elements</a> which <strong>must</strong> behave as <a>inert</a>, or not part of the <a>document tree</a>,
              unless they are <a>being rendered</a>.
              In other words, if they don't particitpate in a <a>composed tree</a> whose root node is a document, they <strong>must</strong> behave as <a>inert</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following HTML elements <strong>must</strong> be classified to this category:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>applet</code></li>
              <li><code>embed</code></li>
              <li><code>object</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
              For example, suppose that an <code>object</code> element is a child node of a shadow host, but the <code>object</code> element is not assigned to a slot.
              In this case, according to the <a>composed tree children calculation algorithm</a>,
              this element never participate in a <a>composed tree</a> whose root node is a <a>document</a>.
              Therefore, this element is <a>inert</a> because this element is not <a>being rendered</a>. .
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>When [[!HTML]] defines the processing algorithms to traverse trees for the following attributes, they <strong>must</strong> use the <a>composed tree</a>.
        <ul>
          <li><code>dir</code></li>
          <li><code>draggable</code></li>
          <li><code>dropzone</code></li>

        <div class="note">

      <h2>Shadow DOM Example</h2>

      <p>Bob was asked to turn a simple list of links into a News Widget, which has links organized into two categories: breaking news and just news. The current document markup for the stories looks like this:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;ul class=&quot;stories&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/1&quot;&gt;A story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/2&quot;&gt;Another story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/3&quot;&gt;Also a story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/4&quot;&gt;Yet another story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/4&quot;&gt;Awesome story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/5&quot;&gt;Horrible story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>To organize the stories, Bob decides to use <strong>shadow DOM</strong>. Doing so will allow Bob to keep the document markup uncluttered, and harnessing the power of insertion point makes sorting stories by class name a very simple task. After getting another cup of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_beverages#Green_Eye">Green Eye</a>, he quickly mocks up the following shadow tree, to be hosted by the <code>ul</code> element:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;div class=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;content select=&quot;.breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;/content&gt; &lt;!-- insertion point for breaking news --&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;other&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;content&gt;&lt;/content&gt; &lt;!-- insertion point for the rest of the news --&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>Bob then styles the newborn widget according to comps from the designer by adding this to the shadow tree mockup:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;style&gt;
    div.breaking {
        color: Red;
        font-size: 20px;
        border: 1px dashed Purple;
    }
    div.other {
        padding: 2px 0 0 0;
        border: 1px solid Cyan;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>While pondering if his company should start looking for a new designer, Bob converts the mockup to code:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
function createStoryGroup(className, contentSelector)
{
    var group = document.createElement('div');
    group.className = className;
    // Empty string in select attribute or absence thereof work the same, so no need for special handling.
    group.innerHTML = '&lt;ul&gt;&lt;content select=&quot;' + contentSelector + '&quot;&gt;&lt;/content&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;';
    return group;
}

function createStyle()
{
    var style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = 'div.breaking { color: Red;font-size: 20px; border: 1px dashed Purple; }' +
        'div.other { padding: 2px 0 0 0; border: 1px solid Cyan; }';
    return style;
}

function makeShadowTree(storyList)
{
    var root = storyList.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
    root.appendChild(createStyle());
    root.appendChild(createStoryGroup('breaking', '.breaking'));
    root.appendChild(createStoryGroup('other', ''));
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('ul.stories'), makeShadowTree);
});
      </pre>

      <p>Well done, Bob! With the cup of coffee still half-full, the work is complete. Recognizing his awesomeness, Bob returns to teaching n00bs the ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon">Splatoon</a>.</p>

      <p>A few months pass.</p>

      <p>It's election time. With Bob at his annual conference, Alice is charged with adding <strong>another</strong>, temporary box to the news widget, filled with election-related stories. Alice studies Bob's code, reads up on the shadow DOM spec and realizes that, thanks to multiple shadow tree support, she doesn't have to touch his code. As usual, her solution is elegant and simple, fitting neatly right under Bob's code:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
// TODO(alice): BEGIN -- DELETE THIS CODE AFTER ELECTIONS ARE OVER.
var ELECTION_BOX_REMOVAL_DEADLINE = ...;

function createElectionStyle()
{
    var style = document.createElement('style');
    // TODO(alice): Check designer's desk for hallucinogens.
    style.textContent = 'div.election { color: Magenta; font-size: 24px; border: 2px dotted Fuchsia; }';
    return style;
}

function makeElectionShadowTree(storyList)
{
    var root = storyList.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
    // Add and style election story box.
    root.appendChild(createElectionStyle());
    root.appendChild(createStoryGroup('election', '.election'));
    // Insert Bob's shadow tree under the election story box.
    root.appendChild(document.createElement('shadow'));
}

if (Date.now() &lt; ELECTION_BOX_REMOVAL_DEADLINE) {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('ul.stories'), makeElectionShadowTree);
    });
}
// TODO(alice): END -- DELETE THIS CODE AFTER ELECTIONS ARE OVER.
      </pre>
      <p>Using the <code>shadow</code> element allows Alice to compose Bob's widget <strong>inside</strong> of hers&mdash;without having to change a line of production code. Smiling to herself, Alice realizes that Bob may have come up with a way to keep the document markup clean, but <strong>she</strong> is the one who takes the cake for using shadow tree composition in such a cool way.</p>
