        This specification describes a method of combining multiple DOM trees into one hierarchy and how these trees interact with each other within a document, thus
        enabling better composition of the DOM.

      <h2>Conformance</h2>

      <p>All diagrams, examples, notes, are non-normative, as well as sections explicitly marked as non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

      <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]]. For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

      <p>To help with layering and to avoid circular dependencies between various parts of specification, this document consists of three consecutive narratives:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>setting up the stage for the specification,</li>
        <li>explaining of the conceptual model and algorithms behind it, and</li>
        <li>expressing this model with DOM interfaces and HTML elements.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In a sense, these parts can be viewed as <em>math</em>, which sets up the reasoning environment, <em>physics</em>, which is the theoretical reasoning about the concept, and <em>mechanics</em>, which is the practical application of this reasoning.</p>

      <p>Any point, at which a conforming UA must make decisions about the state or reaction to the state of the conceptual model, is captured as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>. The algorithms are defined in terms of processing equivalence. The <dfn>processing equivalence</dfn> is a constraint imposed on the algorithm implementors, requiring the output of the both UA-implemented and the specified algorithm to be exactly the same for all inputs.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          See the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/">Shadow DOM 101</a> as a non-normative introduction.

        <h3>Shadow trees</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>document tree</dfn> is a <a>node tree</a> [[!DOM]] whose <a>root</a> <a>node</a> is a <a>document</a>.</p>

        <p>Any element can have an <dfn title="shadow roots list">associated ordered list</dfn> of zero or more <a title="node tree">node trees</a>.</p>

        <p>An element <dfn>hosts</dfn> a <a>node tree</a> if the <a>node tree</a> is a member of this associated list.</p>

        <p>A <dfn>shadow host</dfn> is an element that <a>hosts</a> one or more <a title="node tree">node trees</a>.</p>

        <p>A <dfn>shadow tree</dfn> is a <a>node tree</a> <a title="hosts">hosted</a> by a <a>shadow host</a>.</p>

        <p>A shadow tree has an associated flag, called an <dfn>encapsulation mode</dfn>, which is either <dfn>open</dfn> or <dfn>closed</dfn>.

        <p class="note">
          The behavior of a <a>closed</a> shadow tree is not well defined in this spec yet. The status is tracked in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27775">W3C bug 27775</a>.
          Unless otherwise mentioned, an encapsulation mode of a shadow tree is <a>open</a>.
          The default-to-open is still under discussion and it may change. The status is tracked in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20144">W3C bug 20144</a>.
        </p>

        <p>A <dfn>shadow root</dfn> is the <a>root</a> <a>node</a> of a shadow tree.</p>

        <p>If more than one <a>shadow tree</a> is <a title="hosts">hosted</a> by the same <a>shadow host</a>, the more recently added <a>shadow tree</a> is called the <dfn>younger shadow tree</dfn> and the less recently added <a>shadow tree</a> is called the <dfn>older shadow tree</dfn>.</p>

        <p>If there is no <a>older shadow tree</a> than a given <a>shadow tree</a>,
          the <a>shadow tree</a> is called the <dfn>oldest shadow tree</dfn>.</p>

        <p>If there is no <a>younger shadow tree</a> than a given <a>shadow tree</a>,
          the <a>shadow tree</a> is called the <dfn>youngest shadow tree</dfn>.</p>

        <p>The <dfn>older shadow root</dfn> is the root node of the <a>older shadow tree</a>.</p>

        <p>The <dfn>younger shadow root</dfn> is the root node of the <a>younger shadow tree</a>.</p>

        <p>The <dfn>oldest shadow root</dfn> is the root node of the <a>oldest shadow tree</a>.</p>

        <p>The <dfn>youngest shadow root</dfn> is the root node of the <a>youngest shadow tree</a>.</p>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>child or hosted shadow root</dfn> of a node <var>B</var>,
          if either <var>A</var> is a child of <var>B</var> or A is the <a>root</a> node of the <a>shadow tree</a> that B <a>hosts</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A node <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>deep descendant</dfn> of a node <var>B</var>,
          if either <var>A</var> is a <a>child or hosted shadow root</a> of <var>B</var>
          or <var>A</var> is <a>child or hosted shadow root</a> of a node <var>C</var> that is a <a>deep descendant</a> of <var>B</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
          An <dfn>inclusive deep descendant</dfn> is a node or one of its <a title="deep descendant">deep descendants</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When an element is an <a>inclusive deep descendant</a> of a <a>document element</a>, it is <dfn>in a document deeply</dfn>.

        <h3>Trees of trees</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>tree of trees</dfn> is a <a>tree</a> of <a title="node tree">node trees</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">
          The purpose of introducing a tree of trees here is to define algorithms easily in the following sections.
          This is a kind of a notation techchique to make the this specification simpler.
        </p>

        <p>Just like a <a>node tree</a> is defined as <a title="tree">a set of relationships</a> between <a title="node">nodes</a>,
          a <a>tree of trees</a> is similarly defined as a set of relationships between <a title="node tree">node trees</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <a>node tree</a> <var>A</var> is called a <dfn>parent tree</dfn> of a <a>node tree</a> <var>B</var> if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
            <ul>
              <li><var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are next to each other in the same <a title="shadow roots list">associated ordered list</a> and <var>A</var> is the <a>older shadow tree</a> relative to <var>B</var>.</li>
              <li><var>B</var> is the <a>oldest shadow tree</a> and <a>shadow host</a> of <var>B</var> participates in <var>A</var>.</li>
            </ul>

          </li>
          <li>If there is more than one <a>node tree</a> that shares the same <a>parent tree</a>, the <a>tree order</a> between them in the <a>tree of trees</a> is defined as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>Let <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> be <a title="node tree">node trees</a> that share the same <a>parent tree</a>.</li>
              <li><var>A</var> comes before <var>B</var> if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
                <ul>
                  <li>The <a>shadow host</a> which <a>hosts</a> <var>A</var> is <a>preceding</a> the <a>shadow host</a> which <a>hosts</a> <var>B</var>.</li>
                  <li><var>B</var> is not the <a>oldest shadow tree</a>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Other relationships and terms, such as <dfn>root tree</dfn>, <dfn>child tree</dfn>,
            <dfn>descendant tree</dfn>, <dfn>inclusive descendant tree</dfn>,
            <dfn>ancestor tree</dfn>, <dfn>inclusive ancestor tree</dfn>,
            <dfn>preceding tree</dfn>
            are defined in the similar way as defined in <a title="tree">trees</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <a><code>ownerDocument</code></a> property of a <a>node</a> in a shadow tree <strong>must</strong> refers to the <a>document</a> of the <a>shadow host</a> which <a>hosts</a> the shadow tree.</p>

        <p><a><code>Window</code></a> object <a title="named access on the window object">named properties</a> [[!HTML]] <strong>must</strong> access the <a title="node">nodes</a> in the <a>document tree</a>.</p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            In the figure, there are six node trees, named A, B, C, D, E and F.
            The node trees, C, D and E, are hosted by the same <a>shadow host</a>, which participates in the node tree A.
            The node tree C is the <a>oldest shadow tree</a>. The node tree E is the <a>youngest shadow tree</a>.
            The following set of relationships holds in the figure:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ordered list of A's <a title="child tree">child trees</a> is [B, C].</li>

        <h3>Composed trees</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>composed tree</dfn> is a <a>node tree</a> which is constructed out of <a title="node">nodes</a> from multiple <a title="node tree">node trees</a> in a <a>tree of trees</a>.
          The exact algorithm of constructing a composed tree is specified later.</p>

          <figcaption>A composed tree</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          If an element doesn't <a>participate</a> in a <a>composed tree</a> whose <a>root</a> node is a document, the element <strong>must</strong> not appear in the <a>formating structure</a> [[!CSS21]] nor create any CSS <a>box</a>.
          This behavior <strong>must</strong> not be overridden by setting the 'display' property.
        </p>
        <p>
          In resolving CSS <a>inheritance</a>, an element <strong>must</strong> inherit from the parent node in the <a>composed tree</a>, if applicable.

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The editor's draft of CSS Scoping specification [[css-scoping-1]] defines the selectors which are related to Shadow DOM.

        <h3>Insertion Points</h3>

        <p>An <dfn>insertion point</dfn> is a defined location where <a title="node">nodes</a> in a different <a>node tree</a> appear instead of the nodes's original position when constructing a <a>composed tree</a>.</p>

        <h3>Content Insertion Points</h3>

        <p>A <dfn>content insertion point</dfn> is an <a>insertion point</a> to where the child <a title="node">nodes</a> of the <a>shadow host</a> are distributed.
          The <a>content element</a> that satisfies all of the following conditions represents a <a>content insertion point</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a>root</a> <a>node</a> of the <a>content element</a> is a <a>shadow root</a></li>

        <p>A <dfn>shadow insertion point</dfn> is an <a>insertion point</a> to where the children of the <a>older shadow root</a> are distributed.
          The <a>shadow element</a> that satisfies of the following conditions represents a <a>shadow insertion point</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a>root</a> <a>node</a> of the <a>shadow element</a> is a <a>shadow root</a></li>

      <section>
        <h3>Distribution Results</h3>

        <p>Each <a>tree of trees</a> has the <dfn>distribution result</dfn> which describes the result of distributions.
          The <a>distribution result</a> <strong>must</strong> be <a title="processing equivalence">equivalent</a> of the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Each <a>insertion point</a> has an ordered list, called <dfn>distributed nodes</dfn>, which consists of <a title="node">nodes</a> which are distributed into the <a>insertion point</a>.</li>
          <li>Each <a>node</a> that is not an <a>insertion point</a> has an ordered list, called <dfn>destination insertion points</dfn>, which consists of <a title="insertion point">insertion points</a> to where the <a>node</a> is distributed</li>
        </ol>

        <p>An <a>insertion point</a> <var>A</var> is the <dfn>final destination</dfn> of a <a>node</a> <var>B</var> if <var>A</var> is the last item of the <a>destination insertion points</a> of <var>B</var>.</p>

        <p>When a <a>node</a> <var>A</var> is <dfn title="distributes">distributed</dfn> into an <a>insertion point</a> <var>B</var>, the following steps <strong>must</strong> happen:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add <var>A</var> to the <a>distributed nodes</a> of <var>B</var></li>
          <li>Add <var>B</var> to the <a>destination insertion points</a> of <var>A</var></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
          <p>One case that deserves special consideration is the situation when an <a>insertion point</a> is a child <a>node</a> of another <a>shadow host</a>. In such situations, the <a title="node">nodes</a> <a title="distributes">distributed</a> into that <a>insertion point</a> appear as if they were child <a title="node">nodes</a> of the <a>shadow host</a> in the context of <a>distribution</a>. Thus, the <a title="node">nodes</a> <a title="distributes">distributed</a> to a <a>shadow tree</a> could have already been <a title="distributes">distributed</a> from its parent tree.</p>

          <p>Despite being distributed to more than one insertion point, a node still only appears once in the composed tree at the final destination.</p>

            The destination insertion points of <em>child 1</em> is [<em>insertion point 1</em>, <em>insertion point 3</em>] and <em>insertion point 3</em> is the final destination of <em>child 1</em>.
            The distributed nodes of <em>insertion point 1</em> and <em>insertion point 3</em> is [<em>child 1</em>] and [<em>child 1</em>, <em>child 3</em>], respectively.

        <h3>Distribution Algorithms</h3>

        <p>The <dfn>distribution algorithm</dfn> <strong>must</strong> be used to determine the <a>distribution result</a> for a <a>tree of trees</a> and <strong>must</strong> be <a title="processing equivalence">equivalent</a> to processing the following steps:</p>

            The <var>shadow tree 4</var> hosted by <code>K</code>. Node <code>N</code>, <code>O</code> and <code>P</code> participate in that.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <var>shadow tree 5</var> hosted by <code>O</code>. Node <code>Q</code> and <code>R</code> participate in that.

          <li>
            The <var>shadow tree 6</var> hosted by <code>F</code>. Node <code>S</code>, <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> participate in that.

          <li>
            The <var>shadow tree 7</var> hosted by <code>B</code>. Node <code>V</code>, <code>W</code> and <code>X</code> participate in that.
            This <a>shadow tree</a> is younger than the <var>shadow tree 2</var>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Let's assume that the <a>distribution result</a> of this <a>tree of trees</a> is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a>destination insertion points</a> of <code>C</code> are <code>[I, M]</code> (<code>C</code> is re-distributed)
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a>destination insertion points</a> of <code>L</code> are <code>[P, R]</code> (<code>L</code> is re-distributed)
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a>destination insertion points</a> of <code>G</code> are <code>[U]</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a>destination insertion points</a> of <code>F</code> are <code>[X]</code>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this case, if an event is dispatched on node <code>D</code>, the event path will be:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
            [D, C, I, M, L, P, R, Q, O, N, K, J, H, G, U, T, S, F, E, X, W, V, B, A]  (<a>Window</a> is omitted)
          </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that the <a>event path calculation algorithm</a> is designed to achieve the following goals:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            If there is a node, <var>CHILD</var>, in the event path and <var>CHILD</var> has a parent node, <var>PARENT</var>, in the node tree, the event path also includes <var>PARENT</var>.
            <var>PARENT</var> always appears somewhere after <var>CHILD</var> in the event path.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nodes in the event path form a <em>linear ancestor chain</em> in each <a>node tree</a>. There are no <em>branch points</em> in each <a>node tree</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <figcaption>
            The relationship between an event path and node trees. In the figure, a number shown in a left-side of each node represents a zero-based position of each node in the event path.
            A parent node always have a larger number than that of its child node in each node tree.

        </figure>

        <p>
          That means if we focus on one <a>node tree</a> and forget all other <a title="node tree">node trees</a>,
          the event path would be seen as if the event happened only on the <a>node tree</a> which we are focused on.
          This is an important aspect in a sense that hosting shadow trees doesn't have any effect to the event path <em>within</em> the <a>node tree</a> the <a>shadow host</a> participate in
          as long as the event is not stopped somewhere in the <a title="descendant tree">descendant trees</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, from the view of the <var>document tree 1</var>, the event path would be seen as <code>[D, C, B, A]</code>.
          From the view of the <var>shadow tree 2</var>, the event path would be seen as <code>[I, H, G, F, E]</code>.
          The similar things also apply to other <a title="node tree">node trees</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also worth pointing out that if we exclude all <a title="insertion point">insertion points</a> and <a title="shadow root">shadow roots</a> from an event path,
          the result would be equivalent to the inclusive ancestors of the node on which the event is dispatched, in the composed tree.

        <h3>Event Retargeting</h3>

        <p>In the cases where event path is across multiple node trees, the event's information about the target of the event is adjusted in order to maintain <a href="#encapsulation">encapsulation</a>. Event <dfn>retargeting</dfn> is a process of computing relative targets for each ancestor of the <a>node</a> at which the event is dispatched. A <dfn>relative target</dfn> is a <a>node</a> that most accurately represents the target of a dispatched event at a given ancestor while maintaining the encapsulation.</p>

        <p>The <dfn>retargeting algorithm</dfn> is used to determine relative targets, and it <strong>must</strong> be <a title="processing equivalence">equivalent</a> to processing the following steps:</p>

        <div class="algorithm">
          <dl>
            <dt>Input</dt>
            <dd><var>EVENT-PATH</var>, an event path</dd>
            <dd><var>CURRENT-TARGET</var>, a <a>node</a> where the event listener is invoked.</dd>
            <dt>Output</dt>
            <dd><var>RELATIVE-TARGET</var>, adjusted target</dd>
          </dl>
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>CURRENT-TARGET-TREE</var> be the <a>node tree</a> which <var>CURRENT-TARGET</var> <a>participates</a> in</li>
            <li>Let <var>ORIGINAL-TARGET</var> be the first item in <var>EVENT-PATH</var></li>
            <li>Let <var>ORIGINAL-TARGET-TREE</var> be the <a>node tree</a> which <var>ORIGINAL-TARGET</var> <a>participates</a> in</li>
            <li>Let <var>RELATIVE-TARGET-TREE</var> be the lowest common <a>inclusive ancestor tree</a> of <var>CURRENT-TARGET-TREE</var> and <var>ORIGINAL-TARGET-TREE</var></li>
            <li>Let <var>RELATIVE-TARGET</var> be the first <a>node</a> in <var>EVENT-PATH</var> which satisfies the following condition:
              <ol>
                <li>The <a>node</a> <a>participates</a> in <var>RELATIVE-TARGET-TREE</var></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>The retargeting process <strong>must</strong> occur prior to dispatch of an event.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Retargeting <code>relatedTarget</code></h3>

        <p>Some events have a <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> [[!DOM-Level-3-Events]] property, which holds a <a>node</a> that's not the event's target, but is related to the event.</p>

        <p>For instance, a <code>mouseover</code> event's <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> may hold the <a>node</a> from which the mouse has moved to event's <code>target</code>. In the case where <code>relatedTarget</code> is in a <a>shadow tree</a>, the conforming UAs <strong>must</strong> not leak its actual value outside of this tree. In cases where both <code>relatedTarget</code> and <code>target</code> are part of the same <a>shadow tree</a>, the conforming UAs <strong>must</strong> <em>stop</em> events at the shadow root to avoid the appearance of spurious <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> events firing from the same node.</p>

        <p>Thus, if an event has a <code>relatedTarget</code>, its value and extent of event dispatch <strong>must</strong> be adjusted. In general:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>For a given node, the <code>relatedTarget</code> <strong>must</strong> be changed to its ancestor (or self) that is in the same <a>shadow tree</a> as the node</li>
          <li>Event listeners <strong>must not</strong> be invoked on a <a>node</a> for which the <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code> are the same.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The <dfn>related target resolution algorithm</dfn> <strong>must</strong> be used to determine the value of the <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> property and <strong>must</strong> be <a title="processing equivalence">equivalent</a> to processing the following steps:</p>

        <h3>Retargeting Focus Events</h3>

        <p>The <code>focus</code>, <code>DOMFocusIn</code>, <code>blur</code>, and <code>DOMFocusOut</code> events <strong>must</strong> be treated in the same way as events with a <code>relatedTarget</code>, where the corresponding <a>node</a> that is losing focus as a result of <code>target</code> gaining focus or the <a>node</a> that is gaining focus, and thus causing the blurring of <code>target</code> acts as the related target.</p>

        <h3>Event Dispatch</h3>

        <p>At the time of event dispatch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a><code>Event</code></a> <a><code>target</code></a> and <a><code>currentTarget</code></a> attributes <strong>must</strong> return the <a>relative target</a> for the <a>node</a> on which event listeners are <a title="event listener invoke">invoked</a></li>
          <li>The <a><code>MouseEvent</code></a> <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> attribute <strong>must</strong> return the <a>adjusted related target</a></li>
          <li>The <a><code>MouseEvent</code></a> <a><code>offsetX</code></a> and <a><code>offsetY</code></a> attributes <strong>must</strong> return the coordinates relative to the origin of the <a>padding edge</a> of the <a>relative target</a></li>
          <li>The <a><code>Touch</code></a> <a title="Touch target"><code>target</code></a> attribute <strong>must</strong> return the <a>adjusted related target</a></li>
          <li>If the <a><code>relatedTarget</code></a> and <a><code>target</code></a> are the same for a given node, its the event listeners <strong>must not</strong> be invoked. <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> is not subject to this rule.</li>
          <li>When <em>capturing</em>, which entails processing step 6 of the <a title="event dispatch">event dispatch algorithm</a>, the event listeners <strong>must not</strong> be <a title="event listener invoke">invoked</a> on a <a>node</a> <strong>if</strong> it is the same as its <a>relative target</a></li>
          <li>When <em>bubbling</em>, which entails processing step 9 of the <a title="event dispatch">event dispatch algorithm</a>, the <a><code>Event</code></a> <a>eventPhase</a> attribute <strong>must</strong> return <a>AT_TARGET</a> <strong>if</strong> the <a>relative target</a> is same as the <a>node</a> on which event listeners are <a title="event listener invoke">invoked</a></li>
          <li>If the event's <a><code>bubbles</code></a> attribute value is <strong>false</strong>, run these substeps:
            <ol>
              <li>Reverse the order of <em>event path</em></li>
              <li>Initialize event's <a><code>eventPhase</code></a> attribute to <a><code>AT_TARGET</code></a></li>

        <p>Upon completion of the event dispatch, the <a><code>Event</code></a> object's <a><code>target</code></a> and <a><code>currentTarget</code></a> <strong>must</strong> be to the highest ancestor's <a>relative target</a>.

        <h3>Event Retargeting Example</h3>

        <p>Suppose we have a user interface for a media controller, represented by this tree, composed of both <a>document tree</a> and the <a title="shadow tree">shadow trees</a>.

        <p>Let's have a user position their pointing device over the volume slider's thumb (<code>#volume-slider-thumb</code>), thus triggering a <code>mouseover</code> event on that node. For this event, let's pretend it has no associated <code>relatedTarget</code>.</p>

        <p>Per the <a>retargeting algorithm</a>, we should have the following set of ancestors and relative targets:</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Ancestor</th>

        </table>

        <p>After we dispatch the <code>mouseover</code> event using these newly computed relative targets, the user decides to move their pointing device over the thumb of the timeline
          (<code>#timeline-slider-thumb</code>). This triggers both a <code>mouseout</code> event for the volume slider thumb and the <code>mouseover</code> event for the timeline thumb.</p>

        <p>Let's see how the <code>relatedTarget</code> value of the volume thumb's <code>mouseout</code> event is affected. For this event, the <code>relatedTarget</code> is the timeline thumb (<code>#timeline-slider-thumb</code>). Per the <a>related target resolution algorithm</a>, we should have the following set of ancestors and adjusted related targets:</p>

        <table>

      <h2>HTML Elements in Shadow Trees</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Inertness of HTML Elements in a shadow tree</h2>

        <p>Comparatively, a <a>shadow tree</a> can be seen as somewhere between <em>just part of a <a>document</a></em> and itself being a <a title="interface DocumentFragment">document fragment</a>. Since it is rendered, a <a>shadow tree</a> aims to retain the traits of a typical <a>tree</a> in a <a>document</a>. At the same time, it is an encapsulation abstraction, so it has to avoid affecting the <a>document tree</a>. Thus, the <a>HTML elements</a> <strong>must</strong> behave as specified [[!HTML]] in the <a title="shadow tree">shadow trees</a>, with a few exceptions.</p>

        <p class="note">
          According to the [[!HTML]], some HTML Elements would have different behavior if they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>, instead of a document tree,
          because their definitions require the elements to be <a>in a document</a> as a necessary condition for them to work.
          In other words, they shouldn't work if they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>, even when they are <a>in a document deeply</a>.
          We must fill this gap because we expect that most of HTML Elements behave in the same way as <a>in a document</a>, as long as they are <a>in a document deeply</a>.
          See W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26365">Bug 26365</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27406">Bug 27406</a> for the details.
          The following is the tentative summary of the discussions in the W3C bugs. We, however, haven't covered all HTML Elements and their behaviors here yet.
          For HTML Elements which are not mentioned explitly here, they should be considered as <a>active in a shadow tree</a>.
          We are trying to update [[!HTML]] itself, instead of having monkey patches here.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML Elements are classified into the following categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <dfn>Active in a shadow tree</dfn>
            </p>
            <p>
              A subset of <a>HTML elements</a> which <strong>must</strong> behave as if they were in the <a>document tree</a>, even when they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>,
              as long as they are <a>in a document deeply</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following HTML elements <strong>must</strong> be classified to this category:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>dialog</code></li>
              <li><code>iframe</code></li>
              <li><code>style</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <dfn>Inert in a shadow tree</dfn>:
            </p>
            <p>
              A subset of <a>HTML elements</a> which <strong>must</strong> behave as <a>inert</a>, or not part of the <a>document tree</a>, if they participate in a <a>shadow tree</a>.
              This is consistent how the <a>HTML elements</a> would behave in a <a title="interface DocumentFragment">document fragment</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following HTML elements <strong>must</strong> be classified to this category:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a title="base element"><code>base</code></a></li>
              <li><a title="link element"><code>link</code></a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <dfn>Inert if not being rendered</dfn>:
            </p>
            <p>
              A subset of <a>HTML elements</a> which <strong>must</strong> behave as <a>inert</a>, or not part of the <a>document tree</a>,
              if they are not <a>being rendered</a>.
              In other words, if they don't particitpate in a <a>composed tree</a> whose root node is a document, they <strong>must</strong> behave as <a>inert</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following HTML elements <strong>must</strong> be classified to this category:

            <ul>
              <li><code>applet</code></li>
              <li><code>embed</code></li>
              <li><code>object</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
              For example, suppose that an <code>object</code> element is a child node of a shadow host, but the <code>object</code> element's <a>destination insertion points</a> is empty.
              In this case, according to the <a>distribution algorithm</a> and <a>composed tree children calculation algorithm</a>,
              this element never participate in a <a>composed tree</a> whose root node is a <a>document</a>.
              Therefore, this element is <a>inert</a> because this element is not <a>being rendered</a>. .

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>When [[!HTML]] defines the processing algorithms to traverse trees for the following attributes, they <strong>must</strong> use the <a>composed tree</a>.

          <li><code>dir</code></li>

      <h2>HTML Elements and Their Shadow Trees</h2>

      <p>Per <a title="HTML">specification</a>, some <a>HTML elements</a> are designed to either not render their contents or have special requirements in regard to contents rendering.

      <h2>Shadow DOM Example</h2>

      <p>Bob was asked to turn a simple list of links into a News Widget, which has links organized into two categories: breaking news and just news. The current document markup for the stories looks like this:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;ul class=&quot;stories&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/1&quot;&gt;A story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/2&quot;&gt;Another story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/3&quot;&gt;Also a story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/4&quot;&gt;Yet another story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/4&quot;&gt;Awesome story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//example.com/stories/5&quot;&gt;Horrible story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>To organize the stories, Bob decides to use <strong>shadow DOM</strong>. Doing so will allow Bob to keep the document markup uncluttered, and harnessing the power of insertion point makes sorting stories by class name a very simple task. After getting another cup of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_beverages#Green_Eye">Green Eye</a>, he quickly mocks up the following shadow tree, to be hosted by the <code>ul</code> element:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;div class=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;content select=&quot;.breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;/content&gt; &lt;!-- insertion point for breaking news --&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;other&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;content&gt;&lt;/content&gt; &lt;!-- insertion point for the rest of the news --&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>Bob then styles the newborn widget according to comps from the designer by adding this to the shadow tree mockup:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;style&gt;
    div.breaking {
        color: Red;
        font-size: 20px;
        border: 1px dashed Purple;
    }
    div.other {
        padding: 2px 0 0 0;
        border: 1px solid Cyan;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>While pondering if his company should start looking for a new designer, Bob converts the mockup to code:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
function createStoryGroup(className, contentSelector)
{
    var group = document.createElement('div');
    group.className = className;
    // Empty string in select attribute or absence thereof work the same, so no need for special handling.
    group.innerHTML = '&lt;ul&gt;&lt;content select=&quot;' + contentSelector + '&quot;&gt;&lt;/content&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;';
    return group;
}

function createStyle()
{
    var style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = 'div.breaking { color: Red;font-size: 20px; border: 1px dashed Purple; }' +
        'div.other { padding: 2px 0 0 0; border: 1px solid Cyan; }';
    return style;
}

function makeShadowTree(storyList)
{
    var root = storyList.createShadowRoot();
    root.appendChild(createStyle());
    root.appendChild(createStoryGroup('breaking', '.breaking'));
    root.appendChild(createStoryGroup('other', ''));
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('ul.stories'), makeShadowTree);
});
      </pre>

      <p>Well done, Bob! With the cup of coffee still half-full, the work is complete. Recognizing his awesomeness, Bob returns to teaching n00bs the ways of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_(series)">Puyo Puyo</a>.</p>

      <p>A few months pass.</p>

      <p>It's election time. With Bob at his annual conference, Alice is charged with adding <strong>another</strong>, temporary box to the news widget, filled with election-related stories. Alice studies Bob's code, reads up on the shadow DOM spec and realizes that, thanks to multiple shadow tree support, she doesn't have to touch his code. As usual, her solution is elegant and simple, fitting neatly right under Bob's code:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
// TODO(alice): BEGIN -- DELETE THIS CODE AFTER ELECTIONS ARE OVER.
var ELECTION_BOX_REMOVAL_DEADLINE = ...;

function createElectionStyle()
{
    var style = document.createElement('style');
    // TODO(alice): Check designer's desk for hallucinogens.
    style.textContent = 'div.election { color: Magenta; font-size: 24px; border: 2px dotted Fuchsia; }';
    return style;
}

function makeElectionShadowTree(storyList)
{
    var root = storyList.createShadowRoot();
    // Add and style election story box.
    root.appendChild(createElectionStyle());
    root.appendChild(createStoryGroup('election', '.election'));
    // Insert Bob's shadow tree under the election story box.
    root.appendChild(document.createElement('shadow'));
}

if (Date.now() &lt; ELECTION_BOX_REMOVAL_DEADLINE) {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('ul.stories'), makeElectionShadowTree);
    });
}
// TODO(alice): END -- DELETE THIS CODE AFTER ELECTIONS ARE OVER.
      </pre>
      <p>Using the <code>shadow</code> element allows Alice to compose Bob's widget <strong>inside</strong> of hers&mdash;without having to change a line of production code. Smiling to herself, Alice realizes that Bob may have come up with a way to keep the document markup clean, but <strong>she</strong> is the one who takes the cake for using shadow tree composition in such a cool way.</p>
