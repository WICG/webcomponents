Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents 
governed by the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and
[Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To contribute, you must 
either participate in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing
 commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request's body or in subsequent comments.

 To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

 ```
 +@github_username
 ```

 If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

 ```
 -@github_username
 ```

 If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
 feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
